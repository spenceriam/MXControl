# Bluetooth Implementation - Testing Guide

## What Was Implemented

All Bluetooth production code is now complete and ready for testing!

### Changes Made

1. **BLEBatteryService** (`src/main/hid/ble-battery.ts`)
   - Uses standard GATT Battery Service (simpler than HID++)
   - Reads battery percentage directly
   - Supports real-time battery notifications

2. **HIDService Updates** (`src/main/hid/service.ts`)
   - Automatically uses GATT battery for Bluetooth devices
   - Falls back to HID++ battery for USB/Unifying
   - Proper initialization and cleanup

3. **Existing BLE Support**
   - Device index 0x02 already configured
   - BLE transport already working
   - Response matching already handles BLE correctly

## How to Test

### Prerequisites
✅ MX Master 2S paired and connected via Bluetooth
✅ Device shows in `bluetoothctl devices`
✅ You're in the `input` group (if testing HID features)

### Step 1: Start the App
```bash
cd /home/spencer/Documents/GitHub/MXControl
npm run dev
```

This will:
1. Build all TypeScript code
2. Start Electron with React HMR
3. Open the MXControl window

### Step 2: Connect to Your Mouse

In the app:
1. Click "Discover Devices" or similar button
2. Your MX Master 2S should appear in the list
3. Click to connect

**Expected behavior:**
- Device should connect successfully
- No timeout errors
- Console shows BLE connection logs

### Step 3: Check Battery Status

The app should automatically display battery level.

**Expected behavior:**
- Battery percentage displays (should show ~50% based on our tests)
- Updates every 60 seconds
- No errors in console

### Step 4: Test DPI Changes (if implemented in UI)

If the UI has DPI controls:
1. Try changing DPI setting
2. Move mouse to feel the difference

**Expected behavior:**
- DPI change applies successfully
- No timeout errors
- Mouse sensitivity changes

### Step 5: Monitor Console Logs

Watch for these key log messages:

**Connection:**
```
[HID Connect] Bluetooth device detected, using BLE GATT transport
[HID Connect] BLE connected successfully
[BLE Battery] Service initialized
[HID++] Protocol initialized with BLE transport
```

**Battery Reading:**
```
[HID Service] Reading battery via GATT Battery Service
[BLE Battery] Reading battery level for CD:37:EE:48:C1:6A
[BLE Battery] Found battery characteristic at: /org/bluez/...
[BLE Battery] Battery level: 50%
[HID Service] Battery: 50%
```

**DPI Change (if tested):**
```
[HID++] Sending command: featureIdx=0x... funcId=0x2 ...
[HID++] BLE write successful
[HID++] Received response: ...
```

## What to Look For

### ✅ Success Indicators
- Device connects without errors
- Battery level shows correctly
- Battery updates every 60 seconds
- DPI changes work (if tested)
- No timeout errors in console
- Console shows BLE-specific logs

### ⚠️ Potential Issues

**Issue: "Battery characteristic not found"**
- Check device is actually connected via Bluetooth
- Run `bluetoothctl info <MAC>` and check "Connected: yes"
- Device might not expose standard battery service (unlikely)

**Issue: "Connection timeout"**
- Increase timeout in code (already set to 10s for BLE)
- Check BlueZ is running: `systemctl status bluetooth`
- Try disconnecting/reconnecting device

**Issue: "Device not responding to HID++ commands"**
- This is expected for battery (now uses GATT)
- DPI/buttons should still work via HID++
- Check console for actual error details

## Debug Commands

### Check Bluetooth Status
```bash
bluetoothctl devices
bluetoothctl info CD:37:EE:48:C1:6A
```

### Check D-Bus Services
```bash
# List all Bluetooth devices
node debug-bluez-paths.js | grep -A 5 "MX Master"
```

### Test Battery Directly
```bash
# Run standalone battery test
node test-gatt-battery.js
```
Should output: `✅ Battery Level: 50%` (or current level)

### Check BlueZ Logs
```bash
journalctl -u bluetooth -f
```

## Expected Test Results

Based on our research testing:

| Test | Expected Result |
|------|----------------|
| Device Discovery | MX Master 2S appears in list |
| Connection | Connects in <5 seconds |
| Battery Reading | Shows ~50% (your actual level) |
| Battery Updates | Updates every 60 seconds |
| DPI Query | Returns current DPI value |
| DPI Change | Applies successfully |
| Console Logs | Clean, no errors |

## Commit Summary

Three commits ready for testing:

1. **Complete Bluetooth BLE breakthrough** - Research and test scripts
2. **Add next steps guide** - Implementation documentation
3. **Implement Bluetooth production support** - Production code

All commits are local and ready to push after successful testing.

## If Everything Works

Great! You can:
1. Use the app with your Bluetooth mouse
2. Battery level updates automatically
3. DPI changes work
4. All features work as expected

## If Something Doesn't Work

1. Check the console logs carefully
2. Look for specific error messages
3. Run the debug commands above
4. Check `docs/BLE_STATUS.md` for reference
5. Let me know what errors you see

## Next Steps After Testing

Once testing is successful:
- Push commits to GitHub
- Update README with Bluetooth support note
- Consider adding more Bluetooth features
- Test with MX Master 3/3S if available
